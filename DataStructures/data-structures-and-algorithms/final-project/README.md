Covid-Free Transport Place Allocation ✈️🚉
Using Linked List and Stacks (C++, binary files and other features)

### Description: 
Because of COVID-19, social distancing plays a vital role in real life. 
Therefore we want to help transportation systems to overhead this problem. 
We will allocate all booked places of passengers so that each of them will be on the safe distance seats from each other.
